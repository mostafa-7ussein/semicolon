## Backend Features

The focus of this section is about the quality of the backend codebase and the maintainability of the system.

### Functional Features

The backend enables all the features of the system, which are described [here](https://github.com/Deadreyo/SemiColon-dashboard-frontend?tab=readme-ov-file#semicolon-registration-system-features).

### Non-Functional Features: Code Quality and Maintainability

The focus of the backend is to provide a clean and maintainable codebase. This is achieved by:

- Full Test Coverage
    - Tests are written for all the endpoints and services. Both unit and integration tests are written.
    - The tests are written using Jest.
    - The tests are run on every pull request to the repository.
- CI/CD
    - The backend is deployed on every push to the repository.
    - The test suite is run on every pull request to ensure that the code is working as expected.
    - The deployment is done using Render.
- Code Quality
    - The code is written in TypeScript, which provides type safety and better code quality.
    - Code quality is guaranteed through code reviews on every pull request.
- Project Structure and Maintainability
    - The project is structured in a way that makes it easy to navigate and understand.
    - The project uses MVC architecture.
    - The project can easily be extended and maintained.
- Multiple Environments
    - The project can be run in development, testing, and production environments. This protects the production data during development.
    - The project uses environment variables for configuration.
- API Documentation
    - The API is documented using Swagger.
    - The documentation is automatically generated from the codebase.
